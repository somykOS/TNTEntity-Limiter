## TNTEntity Limiter
Freeze the TNT until it fits into the maximum amount of primed TNT

Config has only one value `maxPrimedTntAmount`. You can change it manually or via command `/tntentitylimiter <value>`.<br>
To access the command you should have `tntentitylimiter.modify` permission.
<br><br>
In the example limit is up to 3 tnt.

This mod depends on the [fabric-permission-api](https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api/). That's why you should use a permission mod, such as [LuckPerms](https://modrinth.com/mod/luckperms).
